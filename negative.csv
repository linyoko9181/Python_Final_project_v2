"We were walking around the night market area and stumbled upon this eatery. There were quite a number of customers and we thought it was worth a try.

The xiao long bao here are served in a 7 piece portion. When served, they looked relatively flat, and as a result, there was very limited soup in the dumplings. The meat was quite firm though, so it was a bummer there wasn't any soup. We also ordered a sour and spicy soup. That was also so-so.

Overall, I won't recommend this, but your mileage may vary if the xiao long baos actually had soup fillings.",2
