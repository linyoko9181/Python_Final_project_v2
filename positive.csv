"It seems to be a place frequented by local students. There was a lot of takeout and a lot of people eating inside. I had the original meat xiao long bao, shrimp xiao long bao, assorted xiao long bao, and mountain rat soup. The taste was ok, and I personally recommend the pao chai that was included in the assortment. I liked it because it had a crunchy texture and a little spiciness.",4
"A friend invited me to eat delicious soup dumplings. I thought that he would praise them for their deliciousness, so I bought a mixed flavor to try. There are four kinds of fillings, fresh meat and green onions/fresh meat kimchi/fresh meat scallops/fresh meat phoenix. tail shrimp
The filling is full and solid and will not be hollow. There will be soup when you bite it. Be careful not to burn it when eating. The fresh meat and green onion meat does not have the smell of pig. It is very satisfying to eat. There is nothing special about the fresh meat kimchi, just like kimchi. Generally speaking, the fresh meat and scallops are also good. You can see that the scallops are not too small and are quite fresh. The signature anchovy shrimps are both beautiful and delicious. Overall, the soup dumplings are above the standard. I can accept the price. After all, delicious food is the key. It’s on my pocket list and I’ll visit again. Purely shared for reference only",4
